\subsection{Lexical Analysis using LEX}
Lexical analysis is the process of breaking up a source program into tokens\cite{citation-1-appel}. A lexical token is a sequence of characters that can be treated as a unit in the grammar of a programming language\cite{citation-2-appel}. Conceptually, a lexical analyzer scans a given program and produces an output of tokens.

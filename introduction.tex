\chapter{Introduction}

Building a compiler from scratch can be an intricate and time consuming task. Compiler  generator tools such as LEX and YACC have been used for building compilers for over more than three decades now. These utilities have greatly simplified the process since their introduction in 1975 by Lesk and Johnson.

This project aims to develop an online self-sufficient educational platform which can be used to tutor students in writing a compiler. Being instructional in nature, this project gives the learner an insight into the working of LEX, YACC and the usage of these tools to develop a compiler for SIL (Simple Integer language).

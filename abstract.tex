Compiler design is a very complex task involving several layers of development. Unless broken down into individual components and implemented stage by stage, it can be a hard nut to crack. Even though this has already been done in theory as well as practice, they are very rarely correlated by students who are in the process of learning to build a compiler. Many students often struggle in the process or fail to comprehend the bigger picture. Often this is due to lack of guidance or lack of proper learning material. To fix this situation, this project is aimed at developing a self-sufficient experimental compiler design platform where students can build their own compiler independent of supervision. In this project, we have used a \textit{back to basics} approach where theory meets practice.
